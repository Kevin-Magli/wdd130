    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Kevin Magliocchi</h2>
    <h2>~Magli~</h2>
    <p>
      Hey if you're seeing this, it's a pleasure to meet you! As you can see, my
      name is Kevin Magliocchi, I live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, I am 22 years old
      and recently came back from my mission in Brazil Porto Alegre North
      Mission. I served during the pandemic and it was quite an experience.
      Serving on an apocalipse (at least was what we tought) was something
      unique and I learned a lot. <br> <i>By the way, that nickname came from the mission, since "Magliocchi" is too dang long :)</i>
      <br> What can I tell you more? I am not married but I have an amazing girlfriend who I plan to get married with and I don't have kids but I have a cat named Nico (gotta start somewhere)You can see a picture of both kitties bellow. I plan to become a programmer because I like to create stuff, but I don't know exactly what I want to create. I also like to play the piano and listen to music a lot. <br> Now you know basically everything about me! If you ask gently, I'll provide my credit card informations so you can do all sorts of devious things! Thank you for your time here, now skedadle, go read a book, do something fun, be happy, anything. Farewell!
